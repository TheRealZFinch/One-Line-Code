# One-Line-Code
My custom programming language<br/>

One Line Code (1LCode for short) is a programming language that I was recently working on.<br/>
<br/>
# How to program in it:
There are two built in variables:<br/>
Tout (short for "temporary out") and counter<br/><br/>

There are 10 commands:<br/>
/: Adds character that is after it to Tout<br/>
\*: Clears Tout<br/>
<: Gets one character stdin and adds it to Tout (First < gets first character from stdin, second < gets second character from stdin etc.)<br/>
\>: Prints Tout<br/>
#: Changes website's background color to the name of color stored in Tout<br/>
+: Increases counter by 1<br/>
-: Decreases counter by 1<br/>
=: Adds counter value to Tout<br/>
?: Adds random number from 0 to 100 to Tout<br/>
&: If character before it isn't equal to Tout skips one command<br/>

# How to use interpreter:
In first text box enter code then press run<br/>
In the second text box you enter stdin
